My name is Leonardo Quezada. Online I’m known as [Leo8bits](https://www.facebook.com/Leo8bits/), I'm an illustrator. Until one and a half month ago—mid December—I didn't know about any kind of cryptocurrency except for Bitcoin and wasn’t expecting that to change.

I remember finding out about the Chaucha Project thanks to a friend who shared some news about a webpage I don’t recall. I read it in the morning, right after I woke up. I didn’t even have my glasses on, I forgot all about it. That same day in the afternoon I happened to stumble upon the same news my friend shared, so I clicked  on the link and read everything again. I told my girlfriend. “*Huh, that’s nice*,” she replied. *“Right?”* I answered. Then I downloaded the wallet.
The next day I had an illustration event to go to, those where nerds go buy stickers and posters. Since I had my laptop with me I decided I’d check the Project page again and I ended up reading about OrionX. That day the Chaucha’s price was 530 CLP. “*Alright, let’s do this*,” I told my girlfriend. I bought 5 Chauchas with what I had left in my bank account. In the course of the event I was more interested in keeping an eye on the Chaucha’s behaviour than seeing what was happening around me.
I entered the Telegram group. Back then—and even today—I rarely ever talked. I read everything, though. Little by little I started learning technical jargon and discovering more about cryptocurrency. I noticed that the other Telegram users sent stickers related to the Chaucha and I remembered a friend of mine asked me to draw some to use them there. I did a few, mainly to promote myself (sorry not sorry). I drew about 4 or 5.

The stickers had good response. People started giving me suggestions and some users donated some Chauchas to my work, which motivated me to keep drawing stickers. As time went by I wanted to keep contributing to the project, even if the Chaucha’s price started to fall around the first days of January. Camilo, one of the Chaucha’s developers, contacted me several times to ask for drawings which he obviously paid in Chaucha. I thought it was an easy paying method so I implemented it in my fan page. It worked really well and still does to this day.
I’m glad I reached this project when it was just starting and I’m glad I can still be part of it. I want to keep giving back to the community as much as I want to support the use of the Chaucha.
