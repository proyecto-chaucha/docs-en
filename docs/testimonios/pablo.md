# The lost chauchera

Everything started when Cesar posted on the Chile programmers Facebook page. I didn’t know anything about cryptocurrencies except for Ethereum and Bitcoin. I had played with p500 on demo mode to learn how to trade but everything else was a mystery to me. Since I had never mined cryptocoin before, I wanted to learn.


I read the Chaucha’s webpage and noticed there were few people mining, so I gave it a try. I think I saw around 50 kH/s on my processor and 180 kH/S on my old GPU, so I just jumped into it and made like 5 Chauchas. I left my PC on mining, I installed the miner on my job’s PC with just 1 thread. In order to keep using it I set up a cloud machine.

All of this happened back in September. Then I forgot about the Chaucha for a few weeks. I saved my wallet on a flash drive and formatted my PC.

When I saw that the Chaucha now costed around 20 Chilean pesos, I wondered "So what happened with my chauchas?" But Icould not find the flash drive anywhere, nor I knew how many Chauchas it had. Then I installed a file recovery program to scan the hard drive and look for the wallet, I hoped I was lucky. After 20 hours checking all the recovered files I found my wallet with the pleasant surprise of 2200 Chauchas, because the cloud machine was left mining for almost a month without being banned.

I didn’t know how to trade, so scared as I, was I selled 20 CHA. Then I bought 22 CHA with my profit and kept on scalping and learning about mining, trading and Blockchain development.


At the end of December I broke my clavicle and the doctor forbade me from programming for 1 month. I could only read or write on the phone. It was then --after reading a lo-- that I got into mining. I sold some of my CHA to buy video cards, a motherboard, a power supply--it was quite a challenge to build a rig using only my left hand.

Now I mine everything but chauchas, because I just don't like renting for mining.


Even considering the current price, I don't regret having saved 500 CHA for the future. I believe in the project. 

It's been one of the most knowledgeable summers in my life. I was cool getting to know all this world. Thank you!
