# Introduction

Maybe you read some news about the * Bitcoin * price, or you heard a colleague talking about his investments in cryptocurrencies with strange names like *Ethereum*. Or maybe you just want to get up to speed on the new technological advances. In any of these cases, this guide was designed to guide you from the simplest concepts to the most abstract ideas that involve the development and operation of these systems.

In this technological environment ideas from different areas of development are mixed, ranging from concepts related to the trust and value of an object, to economic theory and mathematical models that make cryptography possible. Despite this, in no case is necessary to be an expert in these matters. This guide was developed taking into account this problem.

As an introduction, I decided to answer the most common questions that come up when learning about this technology in a simple and clear way, including concepts that will be presented in detail in the following chapters of this guide.

## What is a cryptocurrency?
Â 
A cryptocurrency is found in a network maintained by thousands of users throughout the world, where each of them has an exact copy of all transactions that have been made in that network. This transaction file is called *Blockchain*, and makes it possible for any person to modify elements of the network without another user being aware of it.

The cryptocurrencies are stored in electronic wallets (called Wallets), which allow you to create addresses to receive and send cryptocurrencies to other users through the network. These addresses are assigned a private key, which helps protect them from theft or computer attacks.

When you get a cryptocurrency in your wallet address, you are the controller of that object within the network, and no one can destroy your cryptocurrency or transfer it without knowing your private key.

## How do I get cryptocurrencies?

There are two main methods by which cryptocurrencies can be obtained. These are network mining transfer between users.

For the network to work properly it is necessary for users to deliver something called *Hashing Power*, which allows the network to verify that all transactions are correct. This process is called *Cryptocurrency Mining*, meaning that the network rewards users who sacrifice part of their computing capacity on their devices (computers, video cards, ASIC cards) by giving them cryptocurrency.

When users obtain cryptocurrency by means of the mining process, they can freely transfer them to any other user of the network. If this cryptocurrency has an associated economic value, exchange can be done among cryptocurrencies, goods or services.

For example, within the Blockchain of the Chaucha Project you can see [the creation of cryptocurrencies] (http://explorer.chaucha.cl/tx/fc3a023cde55d073fdb65322d36090d4b5c7806520c9a436adcc49ed07d797ef) through the mining process, and the [cryptocurrency transfer] (http: //explorer.chaucha.cl/tx/c60440e22dd77583fc484382a21e60284a36cf8885212e150f6073a7602dc46f) among users.

## What is the price of cryptocurrencies?

The commercial value of a cryptocurrency is based on three essential aspects:

* There are users who have cryptocurrencies and want to sell
* There are users who want to obtain cryptocurrencies and want to buy
* There is a market where you can buy or sell cryptocurrencies

These three points must be met for a cryptocurrency to obtain a market value.

Each user wants to get the most benefit from this transaction. People who sell cryptocurrency are always going to try to sell them at the highest possible price. On the contrary, people who want to buy some cryptocurrency will always seek to spend the least amount of money possible. Based on this, the market price is set between the minimum sale value and the maximum purchase value.

This way of setting a market price is produced by the use of something called *order book* (or book of orders), where users generate public purchase and sale orders in the market. This can be seen in platforms such as [Gdax] (https://www.gdax.com/trade/ETH-USD), which show the variation of the order book in real time.

## What are cryptocurrencies for?

A cryptocurrency has three important features. It is possible to store and exchange them. They have a market price and present encryption systems to maintain security and record transactions. Finally, and because of all these this, it is possible to use them in many different ways, just as money is used in a society.


### Commerce

When the Bitcoin network was born, no one had any idea what could be done with this currency, since the first users involved in its development  only focused on the technical field and not on the social or cultural repercussion caused by the existence of a "World currency".

The first documented use of a cryptocurrency was on May 17, 2010, where [Laszlo Hanyecz] (https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Laszlo_Hanyecz) convinced another Bitcoin user to exchange two pizzas for 10000 BTC . This landmark in the history of bitcoin is known as "The most expensive pizza in the world", and every year this day is celebrated by calculating the current price of this transaction.

After this transaction in real life, Bitcoin users decided to boost trade. Unfortunately due to network scalability related problems, this cryptocurrency has not been implemented as a quick and effective alternative to make transactions for goods or services.-

Many changes have been tried from the technological point of view to streamline transactions and reduce the tax, but unfortunately --again-- it is not yet possible to build a both free and instant-to-transfer cryptocurrency.

It should be noted that there are virtual stores that accept Bitcoin and other types of cryptocurrencies, and transactions of goods and services with cryptocurrencies are still carried out as exchanges.

### Anonymity

Cryptocurrencies do not linking people with a network addresses, which makes it difficult to trace the origin of a transaction. For this reason, cryptocurrencies have also been used to move amounts of money anonymously.

In this topic there are examples like the [WannaCry Ransomware] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WannaCry_ransomware_attack), which affected the world in May of 2017 and charged a reward to decrypt files from infected machines, and the famous case of [Silk Road] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Road_ (marketplace)), which allowed exchanging bitcoins for drugs, weapons and illegal services.

Within the world of cryptocurrencies there are systems that are known as *anonymous cryptocurrencies*, such as [PIVX] (https://pivx.org/), [Monero] (https://getmonero.org/) and [Bytecoin] (https://bytecoin.org/), and have the quality of omitting key information within your Blockchain so as not to disclose the users involved in the transactions. Once bitcoins are exchanged for one of these currencies it is impossible to know the destination of the transaction.

Another use anonymity is money laundering, which occurs when people or institutions transfer large amounts of money to themselves to "clean" its origin. This actions are actively investigated and considered a crime.

### Store of value

This term can be translated as *a good that can be stored and that keeps its value in the future*, such as gold or jewels.

Many people buy cryptocurrencies to store them (term known as *HODL*), and this allows the amount of coins in circulation to be lower and increases the price due to the decrease in supply. This concept is based on the success of Bitcoin and the wealth that generated the first users of this cryptocurrency, based on the idea that *if it already happened, it can happen again* .

For this reason, many people invest in cryptocurrencies that are in their early stages of development. There are even public offerings of cryptocurrencies (called ICO), where *tokens* are auctioned that will be equivalent to cryptocurrencies that will be developed in the future. Thanks to this, we have been able to finance many innovative projects without the need for investment by developers or other entities. This also allowed a considerable increase in the creation of cryptocurrencies trying to get easy money.

All in all, my opinion is that users must be informed before investing in a project, as no cryptocurrency created after Bitcoin has experience a similar growth. Moreover, it is impossible to predict what will happen in the future. Therefore, you should only rely on projects that can prove their capabilities, and not only on promises or ideas that may never see the light.


### Betting and gambling

Cryptocurrencies are considered a form of multinational money, because they can be transferred among countries without the need for government regulations or taxes. This quality of cryptocurrencies makes them a perfect alternative to place bets and implement games of chance that maintain an open and transparent registry of their operation.

The methods of betting/gambling with cryptocurrencies are based on the process automation and randomly generating numbers. In some cases, code lines are coded to interact immediately if a transaction occurs at a specific address (this is called Smart Contract). In other cases, the Blockchain is used to support random number generation.

These betting/gambling systems can also be used to scam people, and it is not recommended to be used seriously nor investing much money. For more information on the legality of these systems, I recommend reviewing the laws of your country on gambling and betting.

### Protection against inflation

One of the biggest problems of the monetary systems is their relationship  with governments. In extreme cases it lead to the extreme devaluation of these currencies. The best example of this can be seen in [Venezuela] (https://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2016/05/04/congratulations-to-venezuela-bolivar-notes-are-now-worth-less -than-it-costs-to-print-them), which experienced a massive loss in the value of Bolivar, and also in the case of [Argentina] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corralito), which has undergone significant changes in the value of its currency in recent decades.

Many people who live in countries under unstable governments decide to invest in cryptocurrencies, expecting to protect their salaries from  inflation. This factor can create an important impact in society, since fear and uncertainty cause people to learn and seek alternatives to protect themselves from instability. Ultimately, this might end up driving the implementation of cryptocurrencies by users and not from governments.

The idea of ââbitcoin was born in 2008, at the time when there was the [biggest banking crisis in the US] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Recession). Within the [source code] (https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Genesis_block) of bitcoin, and even in the [Satoshi Nakamoto's first post] (http://p2pfoundation.ning.com/forum/topics/ bitcoin-open-source) it is possible to find clues that explain how this crisis influenced the creation of this cryptocurrency.

Based on this, it is reasonable to think that cryptocurrencies are the perfect tool to survive a crisis.
